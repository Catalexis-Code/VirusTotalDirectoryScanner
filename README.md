# VirusTotalDirectoryScanner

**VirusTotalDirectoryScanner** is a robust desktop application built with **.NET 10** and **Avalonia UI** that automates the process of scanning files for malware. It monitors a specific directory (we recommend that you configure it to your downloads directory), automatically uploads new files to [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/), and sorts them into "Clean" or "Compromised" folders based on the scan results.

## About VirusTotal

## What is Virus Total? 
**VirusTotal** is a free cloud-based malware scanning service that checks files using dozens of antivirus engines. It helps detect threats missed by single tools, provides quick results, and leverages community data for improved accuracy. Integrating it ensures a fast, reliable, and comprehensive way to verify file safety.


## 🚀 Features

*   **Real-time Directory Monitoring**: Automatically detects new files added to a watched folder.
*   **VirusTotal API Integration**: Seamlessly uploads and scans files using the VirusTotal v3 API.
*   **Automated Sorting**:
    *   **Clean**: Files with no detections are moved to a safe directory.
    *   **Compromised**: Files with detections are isolated in a separate directory.
*   **Smart Quota Management**: Built-in rate limiting to respect your VirusTotal API quotas (requests per minute, day, and month).
*   **Modern UI**: Clean and responsive user interface built with Avalonia UI.
*   **Configurable**: Easy management of API keys, directory paths, and scan settings.

## 🏃 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/VirusTotalDirectoryScanner.git
cd VirusTotalDirectoryScanner
```

### 2. Configuration

The application requires a VirusTotal API Key to function. You can configure this securely using .NET User Secrets during development or via the Settings UI in the application.

**Using User Secrets (Recommended for Dev):**

```bash
cd VirusTotalDirectoryScanner
dotnet user-secrets init
dotnet user-secrets set "VirusTotal:ApiKey" "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

**Using the UI:**
1. Run the application.
2. Click on the **Settings** button.
3. Enter your API Key and configure the directories.

### 3. Build and Run

```bash
dotnet build
dotnet run --project VirusTotalDirectoryScanner
```

## 📖 Usage

1.  **Configure Directories**:
    *   **Scan Directory**: The folder where you will drop files to be scanned.
    *   **Clean Directory**: Where safe files will be moved.
    *   **Compromised Directory**: Where malicious files will be moved.
2.  **Start Scanning**: Click the "Start" button on the main dashboard.
3.  **Drop Files**: Place any file into the **Scan Directory**.
4.  **Monitor**: Watch the application log as it detects, uploads, and sorts your files.
